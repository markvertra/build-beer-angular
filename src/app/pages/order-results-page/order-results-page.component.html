  Thank you very much for your order.

  Over the next few weeks you will receive progress updates as your beer
  is gradually made. 

  Your beer will arrive having been bottle conditioned for approximately two weeks.

  From this point you can begin tasting it and it will taste great, but we recommend that you
  store it for a further week or two for it to reach peak flavour.

  Thanks!

  The Beer Builder Team
